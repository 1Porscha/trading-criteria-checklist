# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my third Mod 2 Project for Per Scholas. The purpose of this project was to create a Trading Criteria checklist utlizing MongoBD database, incorporate CRUD (create, read, update and delete), on a react application. I was inspired by my interest in the forex market. I was taught, if your trading style does not meet all criterias befor entering the trade, don't place the trade. So, I created a checklist to follow the criteria before you enter a trade.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Programming skills used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Express
- Node
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- React
- BootStrap

## Getting Started

You will want to start on github and clone the repository. You go yo you terminal and paste the weblink. After the repo in install, youll want to install all dependency used the the project. After installaction, you will want to restart you server and lastly tun npm run dev to delop the project at local host 3000. 


## Unsolved Problems

At the moment, I do not have any errors that I am aware of.

## Future EnHancements

If the future, I like to another page the keep track of time time a trade was place and what pair was traded. This will help to see if there are trading patterning I should pay attention to. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
