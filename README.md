# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my third Mod 2 Project for Per Scholas. The purpose of this project was to create a Trading Criteria Checklist utlizing MongoBD database, incorporate CRUD (create, read, update and delete), on a react application. I was inspired by my interest in the forex market. I was taught, if your trading style does not meet all criterias before entering the trade, don't place the trade. So, I created a checklist to ensure I follow all requirements before I enter a trade.
